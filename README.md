# Modals-JavaScript
This is a demo of how modals are implemented in JavaScript. I built this while learning JavaScript. 

1. In the first screenshot there are three button. Clicking on any of these will open the modal.

2. To close the popup you can press 'esc' key, click on the 'X button in the modal or you can click anywhere outside the modal.
